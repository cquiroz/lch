# LTTS will pick either closest AzEl or RaDec target, so if you want LTTS to use a particular RaDec target
# (or use no target at all) make sure to set currentAz and currentEl to something that does not match an AzEl
# target in the database and set telescopeRA and telescopeDec to what you need (and vice versa).

# these are the relevant "current" positions used to find closest target
